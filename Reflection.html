        <p>The goal of this Project was to design and create an enclosure that an electronics circuit would fit in. To begin the process I first had to solder the electronics circuit, which was far more frustrating than I anticipated. I had to pay close attention to the orientation of the parts because I had mistakenly placed one in the wrong direction which led to me having to tediously remove the solder and then solder the part again. Following the completion of the circuit, I began designing the enclosure, which was definitely more fun. I knew I wanted some sort of sliding back door, so I researched online to find the specific type I was looking for. In the end I followed a youtube tutorial for creating a dovetail joint and learned a lot about the tools on fusion such as the joint function. I did not incorporate this, but I learned that you could animate the function of the object. Once I finished the design we printed the model and found that the circuit did not quite fit. We decided that by measuring the overlap that 6mm would suffice. After adjusting we successfully printed the enclosure and the electronics circuit fit in length and width, but the height was not quite right. One last time we printed, finally getting the dimensions right and were ready to move towards the laser cutting.

        <p> Once we were finished with the fusion modeled box we were able to move on to modeling for the laser cutter. To begin we followed the youtube video, but found that it was a very ineffective way to create the enclosure. We found that Timâ€™s method was far easier for us and made more sense. The creation of the box was straightforward, but once completed I ran into major problems when trying to change the parameters. This proved to be too complicated to fix in the little time we had. As a result I downloaded a premade model, so that I could continue on towards finishing the project. The model I downloaded also had problems when I changed the parameters, but not nearly as bad. The problem was that on the length side the finger joints would not change in conjunction with the change in parameters. While I could not fix this in the time we had, it was still possible to cut and be put together so continued. After the first cut I found that the dimensions needed some altering, but other than that it was successful. Next, I altered the model, creating the cutouts for the display and buttons, adjusting the dimensions as well. These changes resulted in a successfull cut and our circuit fit.
