        <p>The goal of this project was to combine two 3D models, remixing them into one model. To begin this process, I found a model of a Porsche 911 on Thingiverse and imported it into TinkerCad. Continuing I found a shape that loosely resembled a hook in the model library and began trying to attach the hook to the car in order to create a keychain. This proved to be difficult because I needed to make sure the hook was the right size in order for a carabiner to clip on. In the end I was able to stretch and distort the model to be the right size. I then imported the file into PrusaSlicer, but before I could print I needed to add organic supports so that the model would print correctly. Once set up I could begin printing. After the print was done I had to trim the supports off the model, which led to some of the model coming off too, since it was too intricate and small. In the end I'm not sure if the hook successfully printed or if I accidentally trimmed it, but I did not have a keychain, so I did not achieve my goal. In order to optimize my design I would have made the model larger so that the trimming was not as difficult and delicate. I also would have made the hook larger relative to the model so that I could clearly see it and so that it was not too fragile.

        <p>For the second print using Fusion 360, Instead of finding a model and downloading it I decided to design a model from scratch. In order to do this I learn to learn along the way, using some knowledge from my previous design knowledge. I found designing my own model easier than combining existing models because I knew what went in each step of the process. However the process of exporting the model into PrusaSlicer and eventually printing remained the same. The organic supports were far easier to take off on this model than the Porsche. I achieved my goal of designing something from scratch. I feel as though my design was fairly optimized and the only design element I wish to improve upon was the fillet of the handle, since I was not able to complete that.
